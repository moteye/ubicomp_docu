  Abstract                 = {Recent studies show that driver fatigue and
inattention are major causes of fatal road accidents. A large
number of these accidents could be avoided if the vehicles
were equipped with a) sensors that reliably could monitor the
attention and alertness cues of the drivers, and b) systems that,
based on the sensor input, could warn the drivers in time.
Today, camera-based systems can measure such attention cues,
and are tested in automotive in-cabin installations with two or
more cameras. Camera-based solutions are non-intrusive, they
can measure head position and orientation as well as gaze
direction and eyelid closure, and they can be used to identify
the driver for other tasks. However until now, no camera-based
system has met the requirements from the car manufacturers on
compactness and cost. Here we present the principles behind
Smart Eye AntiSleep, which is a compact one-camera system
specially designed for automotive in-cabin applications.
AntiSleep measures 3D head position, head orientation, gaze
direction and eyelid closures. AntiSleep uses one camera and
two IR-flashes. With its own illumination, AntiSleep is highly
robust to all natural illumination conditions and can efficiently
handle disturbing reflexes in eyeglasses. The system is fully
automatic and requires no manual intervention during initial-
isation.},

However, in gaze controlled systems object selection is still suboptimal: Dwell times on a certain object typically used to elicit the selection of this object can cause unintended selections; a problem known as Midas Touch. For our suggested alternative approach using anti-saccades for selection, highlighted objects are copied to one side of the object. The object is selected when fixating to the side opposed to that copy requiring to inhibit an automatic response towards new objects. A user study revealed shorter task completion times, but more errors when selecting objects by anti-saccades relative to selection by individually and task-specifically adapted dwell times. With certain improvements, anti-saccades can become a serious alternative to dwell times.},

This paper discusses some of the human factors and technical considerations that arise in trying to use eye movements as an input medium, describes our approach and the first eye movement-based interaction techniques that we have devised and implemented in our laboratory, and reports our experiences and observations on them.},

  Abstract                 = {Over the last 100 years it has become much easier to operate a car. However in recent years the number of functions a user can control while driving has greatly increased. Infotainment, entertainment and comfort systems as well as driver assistance contribute to this trend. Interaction with these systems plays an important role, as on one hand this can improve the user experience while driving but on the other hand it may distract from the primary task of driving. User interfaces in cars differ regarding the number of input and output devices and their placement in the car to a great extent. In this paper, we introduce a first design space for driver-based automotive user interfaces that allows a comprehensive description of input and output devices in a car with regard to placement and modality. This design space is intended to provide a basis for analyzing and discussing different user interface arrangements in cars, to compare alternative user interface setups, and to identify new opportunities for interaction and placement of controls. We present a graphical representation of the design space and discuss its usage in detail based on several examples. To assess the completeness of the proposed design space we used it to classify and compare user interfaces from more than 100 cars shown at IAA2007, cars from the BMW museum, and from the A2Mac1 image database.},

  Abstract                 = {Eye tracking is one of the key technologies for future driver assistance systems since human eyes contain much information about the driver's condition such as gaze, attention level, and fatigue level. Thus, nonintrusive methods for eye detection and tracking are important for many applications of vision-based driver-automotive interaction. One problem common to many eye tracking methods proposed so far is their sensitivity to lighting condition change. This tends to significantly limit their scope for automotive applications. In this paper we present a new realtime eye detection and tracking method that works under variable and realistic lighting conditions. By combining imaging by using IR light and appearance-based object recognition techniques, our method can robustly track eyes even when the pupils are not very bright due to significant external illumination interferences. The appearance model is incorporated in both eye detection and tracking via the use of a support vector machine and mean shift tracking. Our experimental results show the feasibility of our approach and the validity for the method is extended for drivers wearing sunglasses.},

  Abstract                 = {Cars have become complex interactive systems. Mechanical controls and electrical systems are transformed to the digital realm. It is common that drivers operate a vehicle and, at the same time, interact with a variety of devices and applications. Texting while driving, looking up an address for the navigation system, and taking a phone call are just some common examples that add value for the driver, but also increase the risk of driving. Novel interaction technologies create many opportunities for designing useful and attractive in-car user interfaces. With technologies that assist the user in driving, such as assistive cruise control and lane keeping, the user interface is essential to the way people perceive the driving experience. New means for user interface development and interaction design are required as the number of factors influencing the design space for automotive user interfaces is increasing. In comparison to other domains, a trial and error approach while the product is already in the market is not acceptable as the cost of failure may be fatal. User interface design in the automotive domain is relevant across many areas ranging from primary driving control, to assisted functions, to navigation, information services, entertainment and games.},

Modern eyetracking methods are indispensable tools in such a development, as they allow the use of eye movement data for control of output devices, for gaze-contingent image processing and for desambiguation of verbal as well as nonverbal information. The main obstacle on the way to these applications is the so-called “Midas touch problem”: how to differentiate “attentive” saccades with intended goal of communication from the lower level eye movements that are just random or provoked by external stimulation? We report results of our investigations of the problem and present a solution based on a functional classification of fixations correlated with their duration. Several additional solutions are also considered together with the data on the trainability of the human oculomotor system.},
